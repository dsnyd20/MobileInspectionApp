# Mobile Inspection App
Android application created as my capstone for WGU's Software Development BS.

The app allows users to create inspection reports for railcars and includes the following design/features:
 - Built for Android 8.0 (API 26) using Android Studio 4.0 and Java language 
 - Uses MVC design pattern and Android Jetpack architecture components (Room database and Recyclerview)
 - Uses device functionality for security (biometric authentication)
 - Users can capture images to include in their inspection or attach existing images from the media library
 - App uses ML Kit (text recoginition) to identify text in images and save it to a user editable field in the inspection
 - Users can share inspections, including images, via email and text
